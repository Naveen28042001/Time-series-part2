    "\n",
    "Model Estimation: \n",
    "    Estimate the parameters of the autoregressive model, typically denoted as AR(p), where p represents the number of lagged terms included in the model. This is achieved by fitting the AR model to the historical time series data using methods such as the method of least squares or maximum likelihood estimation.\n",

    "Model Validation: \n",
    "    Validate the fitted autoregressive model to ensure that it accurately captures the temporal dependencies and autocorrelation present in the data. Use diagnostic checks and statistical tests to assess the model's performance, such as examining the residuals for patterns and conducting tests for autocorrelation.\n",

    "Q6. What is a moving average (MA) model and how does it differ from other time series models?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Moving Average (MA) model is a time series model that predicts future values based on a linear combination of past prediction errors. It is used to capture the short-term dependencies and fluctuations in the time series data. Unlike Autoregressive (AR) models, which use past values of the variable being forecasted to make predictions, MA models use the errors or residuals from previous forecasts to make future predictions.\n",

    "The key characteristics and differences of the Moving Average (MA) model compared to other time series models are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error-Based Forecasting: \n",
    "    MA models utilize the errors or residuals from past forecasts to make predictions for future values, focusing on capturing short-term dependencies and random fluctuations in the data. This differs from AR models, which use past values of the variable itself for forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smoothing Effect: \n",
    "    MA models are effective in smoothing out short-term fluctuations and noise in the data, making them suitable for filtering out random variations and providing a more stable and accurate forecast, especially in the presence of random shocks or short-term irregularities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Order of Model: \n",
    "    The order of an MA model, denoted as MA(q), represents the number of lagged terms of the error used in the model.

It incorporates both the past values of the variable being forecasted and the past forecast errors to capture both the short-term and long-term dependencies and fluctuations in the time series data.\n",

    "The key differences between a mixed ARMA model and individual AR or MA models are as follows:\n",
    "Combined Components: \n",
    "    A mixed ARMA model combines both the AR and MA components, allowing it to capture both the autoregressive relationships based on past values and the moving average relationships based on past errors simultaneously. This enables the model to capture a broader range of dependencies and patterns present in the data compared to standalone AR or MA models.\n",

    "Flexibility in Modeling: \n",
    "    The mixed ARMA model offers greater flexibility in modeling various types of time series data, as it can capture both short-term and long-term dependencies, trends, and fluctuations. It is suitable for data with complex temporal patterns and dynamics that cannot be fully captured by standalone AR or MA models.\n",
